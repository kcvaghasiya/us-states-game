# U.S States Map Game

## Overview

This is a simple educational game that helps you learn the names and locations of U.S states. The game uses the `turtle` library for graphics and `pandas` for handling the data.

## Features

- A U.S map will be displayed using the turtle graphics.
- A popup window will ask to enter the name of a U.S state.
- If the entered state name is correct, it will be placed at the right location on the map.
- At the end of the game, the number of state names entered correctly will be counted.
